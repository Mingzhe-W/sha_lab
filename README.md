# sha_lab

This repository contains an implementation of secure hash functions.

It is purly implemented for learning purpose, and do not guarantee correctness. 

it has two folder contain codes in python and circom.

* NIST Secure Hash Standard (SHS) https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-4/upd1/final

The author write a step-by-step explanation for implementation in the code comments.
